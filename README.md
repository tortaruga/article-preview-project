### Built with

### What I learned

I learned how to make a tooltip with an arrow! That was fun. I also learned that firefox will not load my js file if the path does not have a dot at the beginning and I host my wabsite with github pages. That was not fun. That took a whole day to figure out, and the best part is that I had read about it in the frontend mentor article before the project. 
Sometimes I wish I could buy a new self.  

### Continued development

I probably overcomplicated things and could have achieved this in a much easier way, so I think I will focus on making smarter choices from now on
